[000.00s -> 004.00s]  To be or not to be, that is the question.
[004.00s -> 006.00s]  Whether to snobler in the mind to suffer
[006.00s -> 009.00s]  the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
[009.00s -> 011.00s]  or to take arms against a sea of troubles
[011.00s -> 014.00s]  and by opposing, end them.
[014.00s -> 016.00s]  To die, to sleep.
[016.00s -> 019.00s]  No more, and by a sleep to say we end
[019.00s -> 021.00s]  the heartache and the thousand natural shocks
[021.00s -> 022.00s]  that Flesh's air do.
[022.00s -> 025.00s]  Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished
[025.00s -> 027.00s]  to die, to sleep.
[027.00s -> 029.00s]  To sleep, per chance to dream.
[029.00s -> 031.00s]  Aye, there's the rub.
[031.00s -> 034.00s]  For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come
[034.00s -> 036.00s]  when we have shuffled off this mortal coil
[036.00s -> 038.00s]  must give us pause.
[038.00s -> 040.00s]  There's the respect that makes calamity
[040.00s -> 042.00s]  of so long life.
[042.00s -> 045.00s]  For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
[045.00s -> 048.00s]  the pressers wrong, the proud man's contumely,
[048.00s -> 050.00s]  the pangs of despised love,
[050.00s -> 053.00s]  the law's delay, the insolence of office
[053.00s -> 055.00s]  and the spurns that patient merit
[055.00s -> 056.00s]  of the unworthy takes
[056.00s -> 058.00s]  when he himself might his quietest make
[058.00s -> 061.00s]  with a bare bodkin, who would for those bear
[061.00s -> 063.00s]  to grunt and sweat under weary life
[063.00s -> 066.00s]  but at the dread of something after death,
[066.00s -> 068.00s]  the undiscovered country from whose born
[068.00s -> 070.00s]  no traveler returns, puzzles the will
[070.00s -> 073.00s]  and makes us rather bear those ills we have
[073.00s -> 076.00s]  than to fly to others that we know not of.
[076.00s -> 079.00s]  Thus conscience does make cowards of us all
[079.00s -> 081.00s]  and thus the native hue of resolution
[081.00s -> 084.00s]  is sick-lead over with the pale cast of thought
[084.00s -> 087.00s]  and enterprises of great pitch and moment.
[087.00s -> 090.00s]  With this regard, their currents turn awry
[090.00s -> 092.00s]  and lose the name of action.
[092.00s -> 095.00s]  Softly now, the pharaohphilia, nymph in thy horizons
[095.00s -> 098.00s]  be all my sins remembered.
[098.00s -> 100.00s]  So she's recording.
[100.00s -> 102.00s]  Oh, what else do you want?
[102.00s -> 104.00s]  Oh, is that good enough?
[104.00s -> 106.00s]  I mean, it's done.
[106.00s -> 107.00s]  Hi.
[107.00s -> 108.00s]  Hi.
[108.00s -> 109.00s]  Mike, Tess.
[109.00s -> 111.00s]  You want to say something now?
[111.00s -> 112.00s]  I still have more poems if you-
[112.00s -> 113.00s]  You still have more poems?
[113.00s -> 114.00s]  What do you have?
[114.00s -> 115.00s]  What's with-
[115.00s -> 117.00s]  I mean, why do you-
[117.00s -> 118.00s]  Why?
[118.00s -> 119.00s]  Because I like them.
[119.00s -> 120.00s]  You really?
[120.00s -> 121.00s]  Before.
[121.00s -> 123.00s]  You went to World War II one?
[123.00s -> 124.00s]  I don't think-
[124.00s -> 126.00s]  How old are these?
[126.00s -> 128.00s]  Just when did you start collecting them?
[128.00s -> 129.00s]  I don't know.
[129.00s -> 130.00s]  Pretty cool.
[130.00s -> 131.00s]  You're the classic.
[131.00s -> 132.00s]  What's a classic?
[132.00s -> 133.00s]  I don't think you can see.
[133.00s -> 134.00s]  Alright.
[136.00s -> 138.00s]  There's your certain slant of light
[138.00s -> 140.00s]  winter afternoons
[140.00s -> 142.00s]  that oppresses like the heath
[142.00s -> 143.00s]  of cathedral tools.
[143.00s -> 145.00s]  Heavenly earth, it gives us
[145.00s -> 147.00s]  we can find no scar
[147.00s -> 149.00s]  but eternal difference
[149.00s -> 151.00s]  where the meanings are.
[151.00s -> 153.00s]  None may teach it any
[153.00s -> 155.00s]  tis the seal despair
[155.00s -> 157.00s]  an imperial affliction
[157.00s -> 159.00s]  sent us of the air.
[159.00s -> 161.00s]  When it comes, the landscape listens
[161.00s -> 164.00s]  shadows hold their breath
[164.00s -> 167.00s]  when it goes, tis like the distance
[167.00s -> 169.00s]  on the look of death.
[169.00s -> 171.00s]  I'm pretty sure that's good enough.
[171.00s -> 172.00s]  Yeah.
[172.00s -> 173.00s]  I'm a dinosaur.
[173.00s -> 175.00s]  We're gonna transcribe this.
[175.00s -> 176.00s]  Sorry.
[176.00s -> 178.00s]  Rex for reals.
[179.00s -> 180.00s]  Mumu.
