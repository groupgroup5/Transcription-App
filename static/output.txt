[0.00s -> 4.00s]  To be or not to be, that is the question.
[4.00s -> 6.00s]  Whether to snobler in the mind to suffer
[6.00s -> 9.00s]  the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
[9.00s -> 11.00s]  or to take arms against a sea of troubles
[11.00s -> 14.00s]  and by opposing, end them.
[14.00s -> 16.00s]  To die, to sleep.
[16.00s -> 19.00s]  No more, and by a sleep to say we end
[19.00s -> 21.00s]  the heartache and the thousand natural shocks
[21.00s -> 22.00s]  that Flesh's air do.
[22.00s -> 25.00s]  Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished
[25.00s -> 27.00s]  to die, to sleep.
[27.00s -> 29.00s]  To sleep, per chance to dream.
[29.00s -> 31.00s]  Aye, there's the rub.
[31.00s -> 34.00s]  For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come
[34.00s -> 36.00s]  when we have shuffled off this mortal coil
[36.00s -> 38.00s]  must give us pause.
[38.00s -> 40.00s]  There's the respect that makes calamity
[40.00s -> 42.00s]  of so long life.
[42.00s -> 45.00s]  For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
[45.00s -> 48.00s]  the pressers wrong, the proud man's contumely,
[48.00s -> 50.00s]  the pangs of despised love,
[50.00s -> 53.00s]  the law's delay, the insolence of office
[53.00s -> 55.00s]  and the spurns that patient merit
[55.00s -> 56.00s]  of the unworthy takes
[56.00s -> 58.00s]  when he himself might his quietest make
[58.00s -> 61.00s]  with a bare bodkin, who would for those bear
[61.00s -> 63.00s]  to grunt and sweat under weary life
[63.00s -> 66.00s]  but at the dread of something after death,
[66.00s -> 68.00s]  the undiscovered country from whose born
[68.00s -> 70.00s]  no traveler returns, puzzles the will
[70.00s -> 73.00s]  and makes us rather bear those ills we have
[73.00s -> 76.00s]  than to fly to others that we know not of.
[76.00s -> 79.00s]  Thus conscience does make cowards of us all
[79.00s -> 81.00s]  and thus the native hue of resolution
[81.00s -> 84.00s]  is sick-lead over with the pale cast of thought
[84.00s -> 87.00s]  and enterprises of great pitch and moment.
[87.00s -> 90.00s]  With this regard, their currents turn awry
[90.00s -> 92.00s]  and lose the name of action.
[92.00s -> 95.00s]  Softly now, the pharaohphilia, nymph in thy horizons
[95.00s -> 98.00s]  be all my sins remembered.
[98.00s -> 100.00s]  So she's recording.
[100.00s -> 102.00s]  Oh, what else do you want?
[102.00s -> 104.00s]  Oh, is that good enough?
[104.00s -> 106.00s]  I mean, it's done.
[106.00s -> 107.00s]  Hi.
[107.00s -> 108.00s]  Hi.
[108.00s -> 109.00s]  Mike, Tess.
[109.00s -> 111.00s]  You want to say something now?
[111.00s -> 112.00s]  I still have more poems if you-
[112.00s -> 113.00s]  You still have more poems?
[113.00s -> 114.00s]  What do you have?
[114.00s -> 115.00s]  What's with-
[115.00s -> 117.00s]  I mean, why do you-
[117.00s -> 118.00s]  Why?
[118.00s -> 119.00s]  Because I like them.
[119.00s -> 120.00s]  You really?
[120.00s -> 121.00s]  Before.
[121.00s -> 123.00s]  You went to World War II one?
[123.00s -> 124.00s]  I don't think-
[124.00s -> 126.00s]  How old are these?
[126.00s -> 128.00s]  Just when did you start collecting them?
[128.00s -> 129.00s]  I don't know.
[129.00s -> 130.00s]  Pretty cool.
[130.00s -> 131.00s]  You're the classic.
[131.00s -> 132.00s]  What's a classic?
[132.00s -> 133.00s]  I don't think you can see.
[133.00s -> 134.00s]  Alright.
[136.00s -> 138.00s]  There's your certain slant of light
[138.00s -> 140.00s]  winter afternoons
[140.00s -> 142.00s]  that oppresses like the heath
[142.00s -> 143.00s]  of cathedral tools.
[143.00s -> 145.00s]  Heavenly earth, it gives us
[145.00s -> 147.00s]  we can find no scar
[147.00s -> 149.00s]  but eternal difference
[149.00s -> 151.00s]  where the meanings are.
[151.00s -> 153.00s]  None may teach it any
[153.00s -> 155.00s]  tis the seal despair
[155.00s -> 157.00s]  an imperial affliction
[157.00s -> 159.00s]  sent us of the air.
[159.00s -> 161.00s]  When it comes, the landscape listens
[161.00s -> 164.00s]  shadows hold their breath
[164.00s -> 167.00s]  when it goes, tis like the distance
[167.00s -> 169.00s]  on the look of death.
[169.00s -> 171.00s]  I'm pretty sure that's good enough.
[171.00s -> 172.00s]  Yeah.
[172.00s -> 173.00s]  I'm a dinosaur.
[173.00s -> 175.00s]  We're gonna transcribe this.
[175.00s -> 176.00s]  Sorry.
[176.00s -> 178.00s]  Rex for reals.
[179.00s -> 180.00s]  Mumu.
